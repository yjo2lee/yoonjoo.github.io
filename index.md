## About

I am a Ph.D. student in the [School of Computing](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/){:target="_blank"} at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/){:target="_blank"}. I work with [Juho Kim](https://juhokim.com/){:target="_blank"} as a member of [KIXLAB](https://www.kixlab.org/){:target="_blank"}.

My research interest is supporting people to perform tasks ranging from teaching, writing, to prototyping effectively by 1) building AI powered systems with humans in the loop and 2) analyzing and adapting large scale data and models. Specifically, one of my research goals is to create computational methods and systems that support scalable teaching and learning using human-AI collaboration.

## Research Experience
From Jan. 2018 to Dec. 2019, as a Research Assistant at the [Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute(ETRI)](https://www.etri.re.kr/eng/main/main.etri){:target="_blank"}, I worked on performing analysis of Spectral Efficiency for LTE with probabilistic modeling and Deep Neural Network. I also worked on research to predict future Resource Block Usage with stochastic modeling and Recurrent Neural Network. During the research, I was advised by Yunbae Kim.
