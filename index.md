## About

I am a Ph.D. student in the [School of Computing](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/){:target="_blank"} at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/){:target="_blank"}. I work with [Juho Kim](https://juhokim.com/){:target="_blank"} as a member of [KIXLAB](https://www.kixlab.org/){:target="_blank"}.

My research interest is using data-driven method, especially applying machine learning and NLP model to solve problems in education domain.

## Research Experience
From Jan. 2018 to Dec. 2019, as a Research Assistant at the [Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute(ETRI)](https://www.etri.re.kr/eng/main/main.etri){:target="_blank"}, I worked on performing analysis of Spectral Efficiency for LTE with probabilistic modeling and Deep Neural Network. I also worked on research to predict future Resource Block Usage with stochastic modeling and Recurrent Neural Network. During the research, I was advised by Yunbae Kim.
